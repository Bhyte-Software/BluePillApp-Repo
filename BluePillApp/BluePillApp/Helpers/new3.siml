As long as the stinger remains in the skin, it keeps pulsating and injecting more venom. So first, gently remove
the stinger. Try not to squeeze it as you do this.
Next, wash the sting area. This will remove some of the venom. After this, apply damp charcoal to pull out more venom. 
A paste of baking soda and water will help neutralize the toxins. 
Cold compresses or ice cubes will help reduce pain still more.
If you show dizziness, difficulty in breathing, severe swelling or hives, contact a physician.

      <Expression>TELL ME ABOUT XML</Expression>
      <Response>&lt;br /&gt; David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible&lt;br /&gt; Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML&lt;br /&gt; is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized&lt;br /&gt; version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which&lt;br /&gt; look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.&lt;br /&gt; SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized&lt;br /&gt; language for artificial intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools&lt;br /&gt; to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an&lt;br /&gt; XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already&lt;br /&gt; familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of&lt;br /&gt; SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable &lt;br /&gt; convenience for programming web chat robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS XML</Expression>
      <Response>&lt;br /&gt; David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible&lt;br /&gt; Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML&lt;br /&gt; is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized&lt;br /&gt; version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which&lt;br /&gt; look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.&lt;br /&gt; SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized&lt;br /&gt; language for artificial intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools&lt;br /&gt; to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an&lt;br /&gt; XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already&lt;br /&gt; familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of&lt;br /&gt; SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable &lt;br /&gt; convenience for programming web chat robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Response>

Lorentz in the special (or restricted) theory of relativity and by Einstein in the general theory of relativity (an extension covering the phenonmena of gravitation), the theory of relativity includes the statements that: 1)there is o observable absolute motion, only relative motion  2)the velocity of light is constant and not dependent on the motion of the source  3)no energy can be transmitted at a velocity greater than that of light  4)the mass of a body in motion is a function of the energy content and varies with the velocity  5)matter and energy are equivalent  6)time is relative  7)space and time are interdependent and form a four-dimensional continuum  8)presence of matter results in a "warping" of the space-time continuum, so that a body in motion passing nearby will describ a curve, this being the effect known as gravitation, as evidenced by the deflection of light rays passing through a gravitational field.</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS A TURING GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS THE TURNING GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

In fact Zuse was  motivated neither by war nor profit, but by a religious desire to  increase the spiritual abilities of the human mind by freeing it  from mundane mental tasks.</Response>

You probably have nausea ... Here are some helpful remedies

Eat a small amount of dry toast or crackers to clear nausea caused by excess excercise. If you are hypoglycemic, add some protein.
For post-operative nausea take two 500-mg capsules of ginger.

Add a pinch of ginger to other teas, to help reduce nausea. Ginger compress on the head _made from the mild tea_ will help relieve 
headaches due to nausea

Drink mild tea of goldenseal and honey on rising to offset the nausea of pregnancy. Put a pinch of goldenseal powder in a cup of just-boiled
water, and add a little honey to offset the taste.

A cup of hot peppermint tea will reduce a feeling of nausea. You can add a pinch of basil and/or ginger. Peppermint tea is a powerful
antispasmodic. It stops muscle spasms in the digestive tract, including those involved in vommiting (But large amount of this tea during
pregnancy can lead to miscarriage. )

Here is an excellent formula for nausea : ginger root, plus a very small amount of licorice root and cayenne.

Make a large pot of bath tea by tossing a hand-full of any of the recommended herbs into a quart of just-boiled water.
Allow to steep off heat for 10-15 minutes, strain the tea into a warm bath and soak. You may after this be able to keep down some
much-needed fluids.

      <Expression>TELL ME ABOUT XML</Expression>
      <Response>&lt;br /&gt; David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible&lt;br /&gt; Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML&lt;br /&gt; is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized&lt;br /&gt; version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which&lt;br /&gt; look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.&lt;br /&gt; SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized&lt;br /&gt; language for artificial intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools&lt;br /&gt; to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an&lt;br /&gt; XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already&lt;br /&gt; familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of&lt;br /&gt; SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable &lt;br /&gt; convenience for programming web chat robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS XML</Expression>
      <Response>&lt;br /&gt; David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible&lt;br /&gt; Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML&lt;br /&gt; is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized&lt;br /&gt; version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which&lt;br /&gt; look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.&lt;br /&gt; SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized&lt;br /&gt; language for artificial intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools&lt;br /&gt; to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an&lt;br /&gt; XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already&lt;br /&gt; familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of&lt;br /&gt; SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable &lt;br /&gt; convenience for programming web chat robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT IS A TURING GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

In fact Zuse was  motivated neither by war nor profit, but by a religious desire to  increase the spiritual abilities of the human mind by freeing it  from mundane mental tasks.</Response>

      <Expression>HOW DO YOU PLAY THE TURING GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

      <Expression>WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT XML</Expression>
      <Response>&lt;br /&gt; David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible&lt;br /&gt; Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML&lt;br /&gt; is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized&lt;br /&gt; version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which&lt;br /&gt; look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.&lt;br /&gt; SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized&lt;br /&gt; language for artificial intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools&lt;br /&gt; to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an&lt;br /&gt; XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already&lt;br /&gt; familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of&lt;br /&gt; SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable &lt;br /&gt; convenience for programming web chat robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Response>

      <Expression Value="How do I tell between a fresh egg and a bad egg" />
      <Expression Value="How do I differentiate between fresh and bad eggs" />
      <Response>
There are basically three ways to know whether an egg is fresh or not;

1. Recently laid eggs sink in water. As time passes, part of the water within the egg evaporates through the pores in the shell. This enlarges the air
space in the egg and causes it to float.

2. The yolk in recently laid eggs is found in the center. As the egg ages, the yolk moves to the side.

3. By observing a back-lit egg, one can see the size of the air space and the position of the yolk. As the egg ages, the separation between the yolk
and the yolk and the egg white becomes less distinct.

The composition of canola or rapeseed oil is similar to that of olive oil, but with somewhat more linoleic acid and less saturated fatty acids.
This oil contains the fewest saturated fatty acids of any, and one of the richest in monounsaturated oleic acid, which protects against arteriosclerosis.
A genetically selected variation of the rapeseed called canola has been developed in Canada that does not contain toxic erucic acid.

      <Response>
The composition of canola or rapeseed oil is similar to that of olive oil, but with somewhat more linoleic acid and less saturated fatty acids.
This oil contains the fewest saturated fatty acids of any, and one of the richest in monounsaturated oleic acid, which protects against arteriosclerosis.
A genetically selected variation of the rapeseed called canola has been developed in Canada that does not contain toxic erucic acid.
